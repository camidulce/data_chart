Highcharts Journey
==================

Overview

This is my journey in building skills to visualize data. I chose Highcharts for its simplicity and compared and contrasted it to D3.
Highcharts Journey is a html/css single page application; it presents my data vizualization learning as my journey through various towns/ countries.

Background

My idea stems from the recent presidential elections in Romania and the power of internet/ social media which helped the democratic candidate win the elections (by a very small margin ~4%). Also, to get my classmates joke less about how 'great' communism is...

User Stories

A user should be able to open the link http://camidulce.github.io/data_chart/ and browse the page, hover over charts' to see the tooltips and click the legend to remove/ add data points.

Technologies used

  Highcharts
  jQuery (jquery.com)
  javascript
  Learned to import Data from .csv files and persist data in the ROR app - Gem Roo
  Used Foundation for the ROR app
  html and css, sass
  Icons: Font Awesome (fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome)
  Used data from the following websites: Census and Federal Reserve Bank St. Louis

Future Plans:

Going further, I plan to work on the idea behind this project: to chart social media usage before/during/after major events. I hypotesize that the increase in media usage reaches 300% at peak.
