Data Chart
==================

Overview

This was my GA WDI final project: a data visualization single page app which charted data in places I lived. 
The project stemmed from Romania's presidential elections from last November, 
when one of the candidates(socialist) boasted that GDP rose, but presented only unilateral data. 
I plotted multiple data sets and compared data points in places I lived. 
The project evolved steadily in the week allocated to it and was dotted with constant decision making about 
what data and technologies to use in order to have a completed product by the end of the week.  

Background

The internet/social media helped the democratic candidate win the elections by a very small margin ~4%. 
The first data set I searched for was the internet usage and compare the data for US, France and Romania. 
Another dataset I searched for was GDP/capita and compared the data for Romania with France and US.
The GDP/capita chart helped my classmates joke less about how 'great' communism is... 
Click on the legend and look just at Romania; then add US and France data - 
the GDP growth for Romania is not as impresive any more.

User Stories

A user should be able to open the link http://camidulce.github.io/data_chart/ and browse the page, 
hover over charts' to see the tooltips and click the legend to remove/ add data points.

Technologies:

The final product uses .csv files, JavaScript, jQuery, HTM & CSS.
In the process I also used Ruby, Rails, Ruby gem Roo and looked into d3js.

  Highcharts
  jQuery (jquery.com)
  JavaScript
  Learned to import data from .csv files and persist data in the ROR app - Gem Roo
  Used Foundation for the ROR app
  HTML/CSS, SASS
  Icons: Font Awesome (fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome)
  Used data from the following websites: Census and Federal Reserve Bank St. Louis
  Used Federal Reserve Bank St. Louis API/ charted internet usage (ROR app)

Future Plans:

Going further, I plan to work on the idea behind this project: 
to chart social media usage before/during/after major events. 
I hypotesize that the increase in media usage reaches 300% at peak.
